## Project Details

### Overview
_ project uses Raman spectroscopy and AI to detect adulterants in herbal medicine. The AI model analyzes spectroscopic data to ensure authenticity and safety._

### Problem Statement
_Adulteration in herbal medicine poses serious health risks and compromises medicinal efficacy. Traditional detection methods are time-consuming and may lack precision. This project aims to develop an AI-powered system using Raman spectroscopy to efficiently detect and identify adulterants, ensuring the authenticity and safety of herbal medicines._

### Solution
_The AI model processes spectroscopic data to detect and classify adulterants accurately. By automating and enhancing adulteration detection, the system ensures faster, more reliable, and non-destructive quality control, improving the safety and authenticity of herbal medicines.
